Chocolate Sales & Efficiency Analysis – Summary Report

Key Findings
🔹 Top-Performing Countries by Total Sales & Efficiency
   Australia, UK, and India lead in total revenue and average sales per box, indicating strong pricing efficiency. However,      the UK's Avg Sales per Box is lower, suggesting reliance on bulk discount strategies.
🔹 Top Salespeople by Revenue
    Ches Bonnell, Oby Sorrel, and Madelene Upcott are the highest-grossing salespeople. However, Kelci Walkden, Brien Boise,      and Van Tuxwell maintain a higher Avg Sales per Box, indicating a more value-driven approach.
🔹 Most Efficient Salesperson
   Kelci Walkden ($54 per box) has the highest Avg Sales per Box, excelling in high-margin sales while still ranking among       the top 5 in total revenue.
🔹 Low-Performing Salespeople
   Wilone O'Kielt has the lowest total revenue, suggesting weak sales performance.
   Camilla Castle has the lowest Avg Sales per Box, highlighting inefficiencies in pricing strategies or product mix    
   selection.
   Both require pricing strategy adjustments and targeted sales coaching.
🔹 Top-Selling Products by Total Sales
   🍫 Smooth Silky Salty, 🍫 50% Dark Bites, and 🍫 White Choc were the best-selling products by revenue.
🔹 Best-Selling Products by Efficiency
   🍫 50% Dark Bites ($60 per box), Eclairs ($60 per box), and Smooth Silky Salty ($59 per box) generate the highest per-unit    revenue.
   Two of these products rank high in both revenue and efficiency, making them ideal for premium marketing efforts.
🔹 Total Sales vs. Average Sales (Efficiency Correlation)
   A moderate positive correlation (R² = 0.6951) suggests that higher total sales generally align with better per-box     
   efficiency. However, some products and salespeople sell in high volume without optimizing per-box revenue, indicating 
   pricing strategy gaps.
